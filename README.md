# PneumaticHand-ESP32_MITAppInventor
An application made in MIT App Inventor used to manage an ESP32 controlled glove with pneumatic tubing used for finger movement to assist patients recovering from a stroke. The project was supported by the Faculty od Information Technologies (FIT Mostar) and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (MF Mostar). Collegues from the MF worked on the physical glove, while my collegue [Armin ƒêidelija](https://github.com/ArminDjidelija) and I worked on the ESP32 and App part.

## Why MIT App Inventor?
At the time of making this application, the goal was to have the app connected to the ESP32 via Bluetooth LE. I've tried to establish the connection while making the app in .NET MAUI, and later on Flutter. Since I was unable to establish the connection (I wasn't very experiences at the time), I looked for other options. After some time, I've found an interesting [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM2ktMKAunw&t=12s) showing the established connection between an ESP32 and an app made in MIT App Inventor used for turning the diodes on and off. After Armin and I figured out how everything works together, we split the work where Armin worked on the EPS32 code and I was responsible for the app part, while helping eachother in buggy situations on both parts. 

##How does it work?
